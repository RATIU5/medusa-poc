# You can add custom configurations or extensions here if needed
# For example:
# RUN echo "shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_statements'" >> /usr/local/share/postgresql/postgresql.conf

# If you need to run any scripts on container startup, you can add them like this:
# COPY ./init-scripts/ /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/

# The official PostgreSQL image already sets up the necessary ENTRYPOINT, 
# so we don't need to specify it here unless we want to override it
